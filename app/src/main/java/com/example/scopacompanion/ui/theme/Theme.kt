package com.example.scopacompanion.ui.theme

// This file has been simplified.
// Theme definitions (ColorSchemes, Typography, and the ScopaCompanionTheme composable)
// are now primarily managed in Type.kt to consolidate theme-related code.

// Make sure that Type.kt provides all necessary theme components like
// DarkColorScheme, LightColorScheme, Typography, and ScopaCompanionTheme.
